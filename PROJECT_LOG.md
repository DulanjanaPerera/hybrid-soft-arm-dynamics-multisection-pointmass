# Project research log

This log records reproducible decisions, datasets, methods, results, and open
questions for the single-module NDI/dynamics/control experiments. Add dated
entries as work proceeds. Numerical results should remain linked to the raw
recordings and the code/settings that produced them.

## 2026-10-01 — Causal NDI length-velocity estimator comparison

**Question.** Before feedback-linearization control, compare a filtered
finite difference with a simple Kalman estimate of `dl2` and `dl3`. The older
six-state UKF in `Controlling/Dynamic_jointspace_feedbacklinearization` used
different dynamics, a 0.01 s step, and an angle measurement model; it was not
transplanted into the current controller.

**Repository state.** Work was performed on `codex/feedback-linearization-clean`
at HEAD `42fc8a0`, with existing user changes and recordings preserved. The
analysis code is isolated in `estimator_comparison/`; no Simulink or hardware
control files were edited, and no hardware was operated.

**Input data.** Six 30 s recordings, each with 601 NDI samples, from
`forwardModelValidation/`: `P1_sineWave.mat`, `P2_sineWave.mat`,
`P3_sineWave.mat`, `P1P2_sineWave.mat`, `P1P3_sineWave.mat`, and
`P2P3_sineWave.mat`. Logged commanded pressure spans 0–3 bar. The NDI
`lengthChnage_m` signal contains orientation-derived constant-curvature
length changes, not independent muscle strain. Ten of 3606 samples had
`orientationValid=false`; both estimators skip measurement updates for those
samples. Median `pollStart_s` spacing was 0.0502–0.0509 s by trial, with
occasional intervals up to 0.266 s. The median reply-completion (`hostTime`)
interval was about 0.057 s and includes BX latency and software overhead.
`pollStart_s` is used
as the practical sample timestamp; its relation to the internal NDI frame
time has not been independently calibrated.

**Data SHA-256.** These hashes identify the recordings used for this entry.

**Method.** `estimator_comparison/compareNdiEstimators.m` performs two
causal estimates from `[l2,l3]`: a backward difference plus 0.12 s low-pass
filter, and a four-state constant-velocity Kalman filter. The selected Kalman
settings are 0.05 mm measurement standard deviation and 0.003 m/s² per-step
acceleration standard deviation. Those values were chosen after an exploratory
4×4 parameter sweep on the single-actuator runs; paired runs were also
inspected, so they are not a blinded holdout. A gap over 0.5 s resets the
velocity estimate. Results, settings, and six figures are saved under
`estimator_comparison/results/`.

**Initial 0.12 s observations.** The table reports velocity RMS (mm/s) in the first three
simulated seconds with commanded pressure at most 0.3 bar, followed by
one-step length-prediction RMS (mm) against the next NDI sample.

| Trial | Valid | Low-command filtered / KF (mm/s) | Prediction filtered / KF (mm) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| P1 | 601/601 | 0.043 / 0.042 | 0.087 / 0.082 |
| P2 | 600/601 | 0.071 / 0.068 | 0.106 / 0.097 |
| P3 | 598/601 | 0.064 / 0.060 | 0.111 / 0.121 |
| P1P2 | 600/601 | 0.075 / 0.073 | 0.119 / 0.123 |
| P1P3 | 596/601 | 0.077 / 0.073 | 0.088 / 0.115 |
| P2P3 | 601/601 | 0.049 / 0.048 | 0.126 / 0.120 |

The Kalman estimate is slightly quieter in the low-command segments, while
the filtered difference has slightly lower mean one-step prediction error
across all six runs (about 0.106 versus 0.110 mm). Neither metric provides
ground-truth velocity, and low commanded pressure does not prove the arm was
stationary. The figures show similar velocity trajectories with some sharp
NDI-derived fluctuations during motion. These results do not justify claiming
that one estimator is more accurate. The simpler filtered difference remains
the first-controller baseline; the Kalman filter is retained as a comparison
and a possible replacement if later tests show a useful noise/delay benefit.

**Next measurements.** Capture an intentionally motionless hold to estimate
measurement noise, then compare controller-relevant delay and stability at
the 0.05 s update rate. Keep NDI validity and pressure-command signals in all
closed-loop logs. Do not interpret filter smoothing as a correction for
calibration, deadzone, or model stiffness errors.

## 2026-10-01 — Filter time-constant sensitivity

The user observed visible oscillation in the filtered velocity traces and
asked whether stronger smoothing would be useful. Without changing the
analysis defaults or operating hardware, the same six recordings were
reprocessed at four causal low-pass time constants. The table averages each
metric across the six runs. Roughness is the RMS sample-to-sample change in
the estimated two-coordinate velocity vector; it is a smoothness measure,
not an accuracy measure.

| Filter time constant (s) | Low-command velocity RMS (mm/s) | One-step prediction RMS (mm) | Successive-sample velocity change RMS (mm/s) |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0.12 | 0.0633 | 0.1061 | 0.6135 |
| 0.20 | 0.0534 | 0.1027 | 0.4064 |
| 0.30 | 0.0464 | 0.1011 | 0.2868 |
| 0.50 | 0.0381 | 0.1009 | 0.1827 |

Increasing the time constant to 0.20–0.30 s substantially reduces visible
jitter and also improves this particular one-step prediction proxy. That
proxy does not measure controller phase lag or true velocity accuracy. A
0.20 s filter is a cautious starting point for the first controller test;
0.30 s is worth comparing offline and in low-gain closed-loop tests. The
comparison script default was changed from 0.12 to 0.20 s and its saved
figures, CSV, and MAT results were regenerated at 0.20 s; the prior table
above remains the historical 0.12 s baseline. A 0.50 s
filter should not be chosen merely for its smooth plot because its delay may
reduce derivative-feedback effectiveness. A sinusoidal pressure command need
not produce sinusoidal velocity when deadzone, stiffness variation, and
transients are present. No Simulink files or hardware were changed in this
sensitivity check.

## 2026-10-01 — First connected feedback-linearization model

Before editing, committed the user's new `feedback_linearization.slx`, updated
validation models, six pressure trials, and estimator-analysis results as
`ee6cd0e` so the starting point is recoverable. The new model had placeholder
derivative, error, controller, and inverse-dynamics functions; its controller
and inverse model were not connected to the valves.

`feedback_linearization.slx` now uses reduced lengths `[l2;l3]` throughout.
The desired length path is sampled at 0.05 s and uses causal first-order
filters with 0.10 s velocity and 0.15 s acceleration time constants. The
measured path takes NDI's inferred `[l1;l2;l3]`, selects `[l2;l3]`, and uses
the physical BX poll timestamp with 0.20 s velocity and 0.30 s acceleration
filters. Invalid readings hold the derivative state; the NDI orientation
validity flag is also connected to the inverse model so a missing reading
commands zero pressure. Errors are desired minus measured position, velocity,
and acceleration, computed directly from these filtered signals without
differentiating an error signal. The virtual acceleration is
`ddl_des + Kd.*(dl_des-dl_meas) + Kp.*(l_des-l_meas)`. Editable initial gains
are `Kp=[4;4] 1/s^2` and `Kd=[4;4] 1/s`.

The inverse uses the same one-section mass, Coriolis, downward gravity,
damping, nonlinear bound penalty, and coupled `1350*[2 1;1 2]` N/m stiffness
as the forward model. It maps generalized force through
`B = pi*(0.013/2)^2*1e5*[-1 1 0;-1 0 1]` N/bar, chooses the smallest
nonnegative three-pressure solution, applies the provisional 0.8 bar valve
deadzone to active channels, and proportionally scales effective pressure
when needed to keep all commands at or below 3 bar. Named logged signals
include the command, desired and available generalized forces, saturation,
and inverse-model validity. The valve Kill constant was saved as `0` (zero
pressure) because the existing theta/phi sine sources span 0–3 rad, much
larger than a reviewed first hardware target. Change the reference and
review a low-gain run before enabling pressure.

Offline MATLAB function checks passed for missing frames, sine-wave
derivatives, error sign, bounded pressure, force reconstruction, saturation,
and invalid-frame zero pressure. A temporary model copy with both NDI and NI
hardware subsystems removed compiled successfully and simulated for 0.5 s;
the logged synthetic pressure range was 0–0.8002 bar. No hardware controller
run has been performed. The two derivative time constants and 0.8 bar
deadzone are starting values, not identified plant parameters. NDI-derived
lengths are inferred from orientation and are not independent muscle-strain
measurements.
