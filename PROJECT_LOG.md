# Project research log

This log records reproducible decisions, datasets, methods, results, and open
questions for the single-module NDI/dynamics/control experiments. Add dated
entries as work proceeds. Numerical results should remain linked to the raw
recordings and the code/settings that produced them.

## 2026-10-01 — Causal NDI length-velocity estimator comparison

**Question.** Before feedback-linearization control, compare a filtered
finite difference with a simple Kalman estimate of `dl2` and `dl3`. The older
six-state UKF in `Controlling/Dynamic_jointspace_feedbacklinearization` used
different dynamics, a 0.01 s step, and an angle measurement model; it was not
transplanted into the current controller.

**Repository state.** Work was performed on `codex/feedback-linearization-clean`
at HEAD `42fc8a0`, with existing user changes and recordings preserved. The
analysis code is isolated in `estimator_comparison/`; no Simulink or hardware
control files were edited, and no hardware was operated.

**Input data.** Six 30 s recordings, each with 601 NDI samples, from
`forwardModelValidation/`: `P1_sineWave.mat`, `P2_sineWave.mat`,
`P3_sineWave.mat`, `P1P2_sineWave.mat`, `P1P3_sineWave.mat`, and
`P2P3_sineWave.mat`. Logged commanded pressure spans 0–3 bar. The NDI
`lengthChnage_m` signal contains orientation-derived constant-curvature
length changes, not independent muscle strain. Ten of 3606 samples had
`orientationValid=false`; both estimators skip measurement updates for those
samples. Median `pollStart_s` spacing was 0.0502–0.0509 s by trial, with
occasional intervals up to 0.266 s. The median reply-completion (`hostTime`)
interval was about 0.057 s and includes BX latency and software overhead.
`pollStart_s` is used
as the practical sample timestamp; its relation to the internal NDI frame
time has not been independently calibrated.

**Data SHA-256.** These hashes identify the recordings used for this entry.

**Method.** `estimator_comparison/compareNdiEstimators.m` performs two
causal estimates from `[l2,l3]`: a backward difference plus 0.12 s low-pass
filter, and a four-state constant-velocity Kalman filter. The selected Kalman
settings are 0.05 mm measurement standard deviation and 0.003 m/s² per-step
acceleration standard deviation. Those values were chosen after an exploratory
4×4 parameter sweep on the single-actuator runs; paired runs were also
inspected, so they are not a blinded holdout. A gap over 0.5 s resets the
velocity estimate. Results, settings, and six figures are saved under
`estimator_comparison/results/`.

**Initial 0.12 s observations.** The table reports velocity RMS (mm/s) in the first three
simulated seconds with commanded pressure at most 0.3 bar, followed by
one-step length-prediction RMS (mm) against the next NDI sample.

| Trial | Valid | Low-command filtered / KF (mm/s) | Prediction filtered / KF (mm) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| P1 | 601/601 | 0.043 / 0.042 | 0.087 / 0.082 |
| P2 | 600/601 | 0.071 / 0.068 | 0.106 / 0.097 |
| P3 | 598/601 | 0.064 / 0.060 | 0.111 / 0.121 |
| P1P2 | 600/601 | 0.075 / 0.073 | 0.119 / 0.123 |
| P1P3 | 596/601 | 0.077 / 0.073 | 0.088 / 0.115 |
| P2P3 | 601/601 | 0.049 / 0.048 | 0.126 / 0.120 |

The Kalman estimate is slightly quieter in the low-command segments, while
the filtered difference has slightly lower mean one-step prediction error
across all six runs (about 0.106 versus 0.110 mm). Neither metric provides
ground-truth velocity, and low commanded pressure does not prove the arm was
stationary. The figures show similar velocity trajectories with some sharp
NDI-derived fluctuations during motion. These results do not justify claiming
that one estimator is more accurate. The simpler filtered difference remains
the first-controller baseline; the Kalman filter is retained as a comparison
and a possible replacement if later tests show a useful noise/delay benefit.

**Next measurements.** Capture an intentionally motionless hold to estimate
measurement noise, then compare controller-relevant delay and stability at
the 0.05 s update rate. Keep NDI validity and pressure-command signals in all
closed-loop logs. Do not interpret filter smoothing as a correction for
calibration, deadzone, or model stiffness errors.

## 2026-10-01 — Filter time-constant sensitivity

The user observed visible oscillation in the filtered velocity traces and
asked whether stronger smoothing would be useful. Without changing the
analysis defaults or operating hardware, the same six recordings were
reprocessed at four causal low-pass time constants. The table averages each
metric across the six runs. Roughness is the RMS sample-to-sample change in
the estimated two-coordinate velocity vector; it is a smoothness measure,
not an accuracy measure.

| Filter time constant (s) | Low-command velocity RMS (mm/s) | One-step prediction RMS (mm) | Successive-sample velocity change RMS (mm/s) |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0.12 | 0.0633 | 0.1061 | 0.6135 |
| 0.20 | 0.0534 | 0.1027 | 0.4064 |
| 0.30 | 0.0464 | 0.1011 | 0.2868 |
| 0.50 | 0.0381 | 0.1009 | 0.1827 |

Increasing the time constant to 0.20–0.30 s substantially reduces visible
jitter and also improves this particular one-step prediction proxy. That
proxy does not measure controller phase lag or true velocity accuracy. A
0.20 s filter is a cautious starting point for the first controller test;
0.30 s is worth comparing offline and in low-gain closed-loop tests. The
comparison script default was changed from 0.12 to 0.20 s and its saved
figures, CSV, and MAT results were regenerated at 0.20 s; the prior table
above remains the historical 0.12 s baseline. A 0.50 s
filter should not be chosen merely for its smooth plot because its delay may
reduce derivative-feedback effectiveness. A sinusoidal pressure command need
not produce sinusoidal velocity when deadzone, stiffness variation, and
transients are present. No Simulink files or hardware were changed in this
sensitivity check.
